    "## Project Goals and Model Choices\n",
    "The primary goal of this project is to build a model that can predict the type of fossil marginal generating units (MGU) that will provide electricity for any additional demand at a given time. This type of problem can be very difficult to solve, especially if the model is also trying to account for factors such as the current demand or the current generation of variable renewable power. We are simplifying the model by treating all inputs as exogenous - e.g., the time of day or day of the year doesn't matter, because we are specifying the current demand and current variable renewable power production.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trying to predict which individual power plant will provide marginal generation under a given set of grid conditions is difficult and prone to overfitting. Instead, we will combine individual fossil power plants into groups based on their fuel type, heat rate, and historical operating behavior using k-means clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using 9 years (2007-2015) of hourly generation and load data for the ERCOT power grid. Using ERCOT also helps to simplify the model, because it does not trade electricity with either the Eastern or Western Interconnections. Over the 9 years of data we see a large increase in the amount of wind generation in ERCOT, and increased generation from natural gas power plants."

    "- Current installed capacity for wind and each fossil group\n",

    "    - This serves to normalize inputs; available capacity for additional generation\n",
    "- Current wind generation\n",

    "The figure below shows all ERCOT fossil power plants active in 2007. Non-fossil power plants have already been removed from the dataset. Unsurprisingly, the coal power plants were running at high capacity factors. Natural gas power plants covered a wide range of sizes from a few dozen MW to over 2 GW. The larger plants also tended to be used far less than either smaller gas plants or coal plants. There are a couple diesel (DFO) and petroleum coke (PC) power plants that show up, but they are usually small. We might check the one larger PC facility to make sure there hasn't been an error with the data processing.\n",

This figure shows the distribution of that last set of data by year from 2007-2015. Its obvious that more and more of the load is served by wind each year.
